# image-classification
 In this image classifier, we created 15 features to encompass what we believed were the most important and notable categories for distinguishing animals in the given set of images. We created features to analyse shape and sizes, overall pixel and color intensities, and corner and edges in out photo set. After incorporating these features into different models such as: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, random forests, and support vector machines, we analysed the accuracy of each model through cross validation and fine tuned them to create our final random forest classification model to yield acceptable accuracy ratings.
